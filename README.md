## Project Overview
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world. It focuses on developing algorithms and systems that can automatically 
process, analyze, and make sense of visual information from the world, such as images and videos. Computer vision systems aim to mimic human vision, allowing computers to "see" and 
understand the content of images and videos.
Applications of computer vision are diverse and include:

- **Image and video classification
- **Object Detection**
- **Medical Imaging**
- **Autonomous Vehicle**
- **Augmented reality**
- **Industrial Automation**
- **Facial Recognition**

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to use our own faces in real time to build our own facial recognition system. Just as we earlier mentioned, It enables 

## Key insights
Facial recognition systems are a subset of computer vision technology that focuses on identifying and verifying individuals based on their facial features.
Here are some key insights and considerations related to facial recognition systems:

-The purpose of this project is to see how the computer captures our faces, eyes, and smiles in real time and see other areas where it can be applied.
- Real-Time Analysis: In this project, we could see that we operated in real-time, capturing our eyes and faces, making them suitable for applications like surveillance and access control.
These systems can process large volumes of video data quickly
- Biometric Identification: Facial recognition is a biometric technology which relies on unique physical and behavioral characteristics of individuals, such as size and shape 
of the eyes, nose, and mouth, as well as the distances between these features. Biometrics offer a high level of accuracy and security.
- Applications: Facial recognition is applied in applications like security and surveillance, access control (e.g., unlocking smartphones), identity verification,
- law enforcement (e.g., criminal identification) and customer engagement (e.g., personalized marketing).


## Conclusion
We have been able to use our face to build the recognition system, This is what is behind the perfect picture taken by photographers, where the camera can identify the exact position of 
the eyes, face, mouth, or smile of an individual and get the picture done. Also, it is applied in Zoom or other applications that capture your image. There is an algorithm which has 
been asked to only capture a particular part of the body. This is what makes it easy for your zoom to capture your body part up to your face and leave out the other background.
So it is a widely used technology to allow computers to see. As mentioned earlier, it is also applied to driveless cars.
